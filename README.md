# 🗣️ VoiceAI — Conversational AI for Healthcare  
*Part of the Healthy.io Platform*

VoiceAI brings seamless patient-doctor interactions to life using cutting-edge open-source speech and vision models. This module enables real-time voice communication between users and an AI-powered virtual doctor — from capturing patient queries to generating multimodal responses with speech and image outputs.

---

## 📌 Overview

VoiceAI simulates intelligent, human-like interactions between patients and digital doctors. Built with state-of-the-art open-source AI models, it leverages voice-to-text, vision processing, and speech synthesis to deliver medical advice in a conversational, accessible format.

This component is integrated with the **Healthy.io** platform and designed for scalability, modularity, and real-time interaction.

## 🧠 Architecture Breakdown

The development is split into four modular phases, allowing for incremental integration and testing:

---

### 📍 Phase 1 — Setup the Brain of the Doctor

> Enabling multimodal reasoning and response generation.

- ✅ Configure **Groq API** for optimized model serving  
- 🖼️ Convert uploaded image inputs to the required format  
- 🧠 Initialize **LLaMA 3 Vision** to process image + text queries

---

### 🧏 Phase 2 — Enable the Voice of the Patient

> Capture voice input and transcribe into actionable prompts.

- 🎙️ Integrate audio recording using `ffmpeg` and `portaudio`  
- 🔤 Implement **OpenAI Whisper** for accurate transcription  
- 📋 Normalize and format output for downstream processing

---

### 🩺 Phase 3 — Generate the Voice of the Doctor

> Turn model responses into human-sounding speech.

- 🔈 Use **gTTS** or **ElevenLabs** to convert text to speech  
- 📦 Package model output with speaker identity for personalization  
- 🎧 Return audio response to the Gradio interface

---

### 💻 Phase 4 — Build the VoiceBot UI

> Interface for interaction with a virtual doctor.

- 🧩 Design a **Gradio-based web UI** to:
  - Record patient queries
  - Display AI-generated response (text/image/audio)
  - Reuse session history for context continuity
